Prerequisites for this package:
    -the armadillo library for linear algebra and scientific computing
        --link: http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html
	--Follow the installation instruction in the package
	--Make sure to install SuperLU 5.2

To compile source files, in the main directory "std_bhm/", type:

make clean
make

To run a light-cone simulation, in the main directory, type:

./scripts/test/bhm_2hs_2pi/konstantinov_and_perel/hopping_quench/finite_temperature/start_in_atomic_lim/block_by_block/hfb/sim/run_alg_1.sh

Once the simulation has finished you will find the corresponding data in:

/std_bhm/data/test/bhm_2hs_2pi/konstantinov_and_perel/hopping_quench/finite_temperature/start_in_atomic_lim/block_by_block/hfb/sim/

You can edit the parameters for the simulation by editing the script file.
